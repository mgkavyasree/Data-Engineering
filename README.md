Data Engineering is the practice of designing, developing, and managing systems that enable the collection, storage, transformation, and delivery of data. It serves as the backbone of data-driven organizations by ensuring that data is accessible, reliable, and efficiently processed.

Data engineers build data pipelines, handle large datasets, and work with tools and technologies that support data integration, warehousing, and real-time processing. Their work enables data analysts, data scientists, and business users to make informed decisions based on clean and organized data.
